looping page
http://thinknoise.com/loopier/

this is a simple looping page i put together to learn about webAudio api.

drag the sound buttons on the page to the tracks above and use the control buttons on the top to start, stop, loop/unloop.

the loop is saved in the url each time the loop is played. This allows you to copy and share the loop you have created.


a later fork of this code base was refocused on Sound Cloud's api for CC sound files
